# Venly Replacement Strategy for Lakkhi Funding

## Overview

This document outlines the approach taken to replace the Venly wallet service in the RareFnd platform with a custom wallet implementation for Lakkhi Funding. The strategy focuses on minimal changes to preserve the existing functionality while removing the dependency on Venly.

## Key Components

1. **Venly Replacement Module**
   - Created a drop-in replacement for the Venly module (`venly.py`)
   - Maintained the same API surface and function signatures
   - Redirected all functionality to our custom wallet implementation
   - Added dummy CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET to prevent import errors

2. **Custom Wallet Implementation**
   - Created a wallet manager class that handles wallet operations
   - Implemented core functionality needed by the platform:
     - Wallet creation and management
     - Token approvals
     - Swap rate calculations
     - Token swapping

3. **Integration Strategy**
   - Preserved the original function calls in views.py
   - Kept the original workflow intact
   - Made minimal changes to the existing architecture

## Files Modified

1. `integrated-app/backend/lakkhi_app/venly.py` - Created a compatible replacement module
2. `integrated-app/backend/lakkhi_app/custom_wallet.py` - Implemented custom wallet functionality
3. `integrated-app/backend/lakkhi_app/views.py` - Added import for our venly replacement

## Security Considerations

Note that the current implementation stores private keys in the cache for simplicity. In a production environment, these should be:

1. Encrypted at rest
2. Stored in a secure database
3. Protected by additional authentication measures
4. Potentially moved to a proper HSM or key management service

## Future Improvements

1. Enhance wallet security with proper encryption
2. Add more comprehensive error handling
3. Implement a more robust storage mechanism for wallets
4. Add support for multiple blockchain networks

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Minimal Disruption**: The existing codebase continues to work as before
2. **Familiar API**: Developers familiar with the original code can understand the replacement
3. **Independence**: No reliance on third-party wallet services
4. **Customizability**: Full control over the wallet implementation
