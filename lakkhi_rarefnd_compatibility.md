# Lakkhi - RareFnd Compatibility Report

## Overview
This document summarizes all changes made to ensure compatibility between Lakkhi's decentralized crowdfunding platform and the original RareFnd platform. Our goal was to maintain functional parity while implementing a decentralized, wallet-based authentication system.

## Critical Issues Fixed

1. **Client ID Configuration**
   - Fixed missing `CLIENT_ID` in settings which was causing application errors
   - Defined `CLIENT_ID = "TheRareAntiquities-capsule"` directly in both settings and venly.py
   - Added `CLIENT_SECRET` value to maintain API compatibility

2. **Token Address Management**
   - Implemented proper token configuration in settings.py
   - Created a TOKEN_ADDRESS variable that can be switched from RareFnd to Lakkhi token
   - Updated token.json to use the TOKEN_ADDRESS from settings
   - Fixed all code that reads token.json to handle variable substitution

3. **Missing Models**
   - Added RSVP model for event management
   - Added RSVPSubscriber model for handling event subscriptions
   - Updated Project, Contribution, and other models to match RareFnd's structure
   - Fixed field definitions to ensure database compatibility

4. **Missing API Endpoints**
   - Added RSVP listing endpoint
   - Added RSVP details endpoint
   - Added RSVP subscription endpoint
   - Added token price endpoint
   - Added project contributions endpoint
   - Updated API root to document all endpoints

5. **Web3 Implementation**
   - Fixed the smart contract deployment in publish_project
   - Updated web3_helper_functions.py to use settings properly
   - Ensured token addresses are consistent throughout the codebase

## Authentication System

The key intentional difference between RareFnd and Lakkhi is the authentication system:

1. **RareFnd**: Uses username/password authentication with accounts
2. **Lakkhi**: Uses wallet signatures for verification and identification

This change was implemented without losing functionality by:
- Maintaining wallet address fields in the Project model
- Adding wallet verification through cryptographic signatures
- Preserving compatibility with project ownership

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Migration Issues**:
   - There are migration issues due to dependency conflicts
   - The migrations need to be applied with specific migration commands
   - A cleaner approach would be to recreate migrations from scratch

2. **Token Address Updates**:
   - The current implementation still defaults to RareFnd's token address
   - Before production deployment, update the LAKKHI_TOKEN variable in .env or settings

3. **Frontend Compatibility**:
   - Ensure the frontend components properly handle wallet-based authentication
   - Update any user-specific views to work with wallet addresses

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test the complete user journey:
   - Connect wallet
   - Verify wallet ownership
   - Create campaign with verified wallet
   - Donate to campaign
   - Confirm donation in contract

2. Test the smart contract deployment:
   - Ensure the token address is correct in deployed contracts
   - Verify the beneficiary matches the wallet owner
   - Test token swaps and staking

## Conclusion

With these changes, Lakkhi now maintains functional compatibility with RareFnd while implementing a fully decentralized approach to campaign ownership. The primary differences are in the authentication system and direct blockchain interactions, which align with Lakkhi's design goals.
